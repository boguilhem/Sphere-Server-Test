Adding missing files from last commit

1. Moved all the base CHARDEF definitions from everywhere they were scattered in the repository and put them all into one file. By "base CHARDEF" I mean the "CHARDEF ###" where ### are hex or decimal numbers. I did this to make it easier to mass update all the stuff listed below and to allow mass updates of the remaining stuff in the near future. If there is some consensus about how to do it, we can split them back into multiple files later when all the changes are finished. The new file is called monsters.scp.

2. Similarly, I moved all the loot templates from their multiple locations into on file (named loot.scp).

3. Changed numerous DEFNAMEs for consistency. For example, all spiders begin with c_spider all dragons with c_dragon all orcs with c_orc and then the type of creature follows. I also changed a bunch of AXIS keys (CATEGORY, SUBSECTION and DESCRIPTION) so that it sorts a bit more consistently.

4. Added elemental damage TAGs to all creatures that were missing them based on info in stratics and uoguide.

5. Added control slot TAGs to all creatures that were missing them.

6. Fixed all the monsters that had ARMOR={x y} or RESOURCES=sometemplate because those are not a valid constructs in sphere. Fundamentally you cannot put anything that needs to be evaluated/calculated into the CHARDEF keys directly... those sorts of ranges or dynamic templates can only be used in triggers like ON=@create etc. Note: To achieve the same concept of range in armor value (I.E. Physical resistance) I added MODAR={0 #} in the @Create section.

7. Added a todo list in a comment block at the top of the file for things that I didn't have time (or forgot) to do.

8. Moved all NAME=#NAMES_OGRE into the @Create section so that other scripts and systems using the SERV.CHARDEF lookups will not looks so crummy. I also set TITLE=whatever instead of overloading the NAME key.

9. Fixed a bunch of bad ICON and SOUND keys.

10. Put back DESIRES and AVERSIONS... I am not certain the server actually uses that stuff, or how its used tho! :-p

11. Regarding the use of CAN= flags... I changed a bunch of those too, mostly adding MT_NONHUMAN to stuff, but I also added MT_USEHANDS to creatures that actually have hands and MT_EQUIP to creatures that have human-like bodies. I eliminated the use of MT_*IMMUNE since I think that concept should be scripted in the combat system.

12. I put FIXME keywords in places that used to have only comments so they are easier to find and fix later.

13. Added all the missing creatures (there were LOTS missing)

* sphere_item_provisions_weapons_*.scp; all expansion files had def changes done. A backwards compatibility def list is included in the sphere_backward_compatibility.scp Transitioning the new def's should not be an issue. I suggest minor updating to crafting systems if their is issues. Otherwise please don't change these new def's. Whole deflists for magic items are done with them and magic items use these new def's. (Note: If they are reverted, I will drop all work on those said items and anything to do with them, their def's made little sensibility e.g. i_mace_wildstaff.. wtf? i_wild_staff is new def. Seems more sensible.)
* sphere_item_magic_weapon.scp; added in all weapons from AoS, SE, ML weapons. Each weapon type has ruin - mystic attributes. SA will get done later today.
* sphere_backwards_compatibility.scp; updated in old weapon defs which I changed to make more sense, this should allow any use with old def items spawned to have the def information converted to the new formatting. Hope the crafting systems will transition well with this.
*sphere_item_provisions_weapons_sa.scp; completed every single SA weapon minus stone war sword and serpentstone staff, they are not defined on stratics. All the throwing weapons are type t_weapon_bow. Since we don't have a type for throwing yet. I will make one later most likely. Everything is EA accurate so far.

Edited/Added:
* sphere_item_magic_weapon.scp Added in Mystic weapons to all weapons listed. Mystic runs a morey of 120.0. Added in Hatchets, daggers, smith hammer,  cleavers, all staves, skinning knives, butcher knives, and long sword b.  Removed all ITEMDEF 0#### as these will interfere with SA items. Fixed Axis cats for i_bow_vanq. Added in halberd of Force and Vanquishing. Added Crossbow of Force and vanq, same with scimitars.. They were missing or out of place.

More to be added later. Will be adding in all and I repeat all ML, SE, AOS, SA items as well as time goes on.

Note: Mystic weapons were introduced during Ophidian Wars.

Added:
* sphere_item_resources_scales.scp Added in i_reag_dragon_scale for older scripts still using that def. It is more backwards compatability, but not really, since the new scales use a specific ID, and there is over 5 scales of other ID's this was redefined, to meet a new standard.

* spheredefs.scp Added new lines to match stratics scroll selections for my npc loot templates. Added: random_scroll_low, random_scroll_medium, random_scroll_high, random_scroll_necro_low, random_scroll_necro_medium, and random_scroll_necro_high.

Edited:
* sphere_item_provisions_jewelry.scp Changed Axis Cats on the silver jewelry to be sorted into Provisions - Jewels and Jewelry. Removed all DEFNAME2= and original DEFNAME= comments.

* sphere_spells_necromancy.scp Changed Curse weapon requirements of 0.1 to 0.0 as it should be. Changed i_scroll_liche_transformation, into i_scroll_lich_form (added this into backwards compatability defs as well. Converted anything liche to lich.

Added/Edited:

* sphere_spells_necromancy.scp; Added in spell 117. Exorcism. Has all the checks minus "issameguild", "issamealliance", "issameparty", and "issamefaction". These needed to be added, but as I see it, we need a stable faction/party/alliance/guild system that won't get changed to add these functions.
